## Data sources
The enrollment data have been collected from the following sources:

- Cohen, Arthur M., Brawer, Florence B., & Kisker, Carrie, B.  (2013). The American Community College (6th). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.
	- Table 1.1 "Numbers of Public and Private Nonprofit Two-Year Colleges, 1915–2011" (page 16). The data set is available in the data directory as a csv file. 
- MLA's Language Enrollment Database, 1958-2016 (http://apps.mla.org/flsurvey_search)
	- "MLA_Historical_enrollments_1958-2016_(3-13-19).xlsx" was downloaded from the MLA's website. Apparently, the MLA no longer makes the full dataset available on their website as of August 2023. Therefore, no dataset is available on this repository. If you need this dataset, please e-mail tnagano@lagcc.cuny.edu.
- Snyder, Thomas D.  (1993). 120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education.
